      <p><em>7/13/2020</em></p>
      <p>When my dad passed away, I was 21, a naturally ambitious young woman. His passing marked a huge shift in my life because he was my best friend. That kind of feeling canâ€™t help making you wonder what is this life? Why am I here? Ten years later, I wonder if I am living my best life or being my best self. This blog or journal...whatever you want to call it, is my adventure on finding out and I hope I can help you too.</p>
